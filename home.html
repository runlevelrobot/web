      <h2>So what is this Learning To Linux thing?</h2>
      <p>
        I am in the process of getting my <strong>RHCA</strong> exam on November 1st of this year. (12 weeks!) I've been trying to get this for awhile now and I just haven't been able to grasp all the concepts.
        So I thought if I created a place where I could "teach" what I am learning it may help me retain the information. Like alot of IT people I have ADHD so it makes remembering things alittle more challenging.
        I also know that I am not alone in this and I would like this to become a place for others like me to use.
