        Today I started on the basics. I learned what the differences are between the different flavors of RHEL. I
        installed RHEL 8.6 in vmware workstation. Tomorrow I will begin getting into the essentials. I know this is a
        short post but I am tired. I will be posting something daily that I learn in my studies.

      I was frustrated yesterday because I could not get my networking to work in vmware workstation. I am now using virtualbox and it's working like a champ. I will be getting some studying in today and will report in what I learned this evening.
